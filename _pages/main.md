“If I knew what I was doing, it wouldn't be called research.” - Albert Einstein.

## Intro

Hi there! My name is Qiang Li. 

I received the B.S. degree in electronics science and technology from Xidian University, Xi’an, China, in 2019. Currently, I am pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, advised by [Prof. Han Jun](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/5f/da/c31145a352218/page.htm). My research interests includes microarchitecture design methodology, power modeling and management, and energy-efficiency of Heterogeneous platforms.
