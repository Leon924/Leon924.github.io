## Bio

I am a PhD candidate in the [CDT in StatML](https://statml.io/) programme, which is jointly organized by Imperial Collage London and the University of Oxford.

Qiang Li received the B.S. degree in electronics science and technology from Xidian University, Xi’an, China, in 2019. He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, advised by [Prof. Han Jun](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/5f/da/c31145a352218/page.htm). My current research interests includes microarchitecture design methodology, system-level power/thermal analysis and management, and low-power hardware design for deep-learning.

“If I knew what I was doing, it wouldn't be called research.” - Albert Einstein.



I have internship experience at Meta (summer 2022) and JPMorgan (summer 2020).
